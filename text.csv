1,"Until recently, the conventional wisdom was that while AI was better than humans at data-driven decision making tasks, it was still inferior to humans for cognitive and creative ones. But in the past two years language-based AI has advanced by leaps and bounds, changing common notions of what this technology can do. The most visible advances have been in natural language processing (NLP), the branch of AI focused on how computers can process language like humans do. It has been used to write an article for The Guardian, and AI-authored blog posts have gone viral — feats that were not possible a few years ago. AI even excels at cognitive tasks like programming where it is able to generate programs for simple video games from human instructions."
2,"This mindset can create new opportunities for businesses as well — but shifting needs and priorities can also bring new risks. What can retailers do to attract consumers in this critical time of the year, as people rethink their goals and chart a new course for the months ahead? To better understand how today’s consumers are thinking about their New Year’s Resolutions, we surveyed a diverse group of 500 adults from across the U.S. in the last week of 2022. We found that two out of three planned to make at least one resolution for 2023, and the majority indicated that they would be making multiple resolutions."

4,"While the sort of new HomePod grabbed all the attention this week, the HomePod Mini is also getting some new features. With the launch of iOS 16.3 (likely later this month), the Mini will get all the same smart home capabilities as the new, bigger HomePod second-gen. The differences between the two Apple speaker siblings are now mainly in size and sound capability. From new temperature and humidity sensing tricks to the ability to find your family for you and even set up automations with just your voice, these new features should make the HomePod Mini a little more useful around the house. These new features bring some much-needed functionality to the HomePod line Both HomePods are also getting a Sound Recognition feature later this year, allowing them to listen for smoke and carbon monoxide alarms. I saw a preview of this, and it looks like a useful integration, allowing you to talk directly to anyone in your home through the HomePod from a notification on your lock screen. But my favorite new capability is something Siri now won’t do — which is to talk back to you every time you ask it to turn off the lights. I like my voice assistants to say as little as possible.The new capabilities will show up automatically once you update your devices to iOS 16.3 and HomePod software version 16.3, which should be available later this month. However, the Release Candidate of the iOS 16.3 beta landed on Wednesday, so I downloaded it to get an early look at some of these new features. Here are some first impressions."
